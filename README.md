Our website’s goal is to provide music suggestions of all different genres to its viewers. Using our own personal preferences and likings, we will curate a myriad of music choices and have them displayed in a manner in which their album cover art is posted on the website and our favorite songs from that album are listed underneath. The user will then have the opportunity to listen to a portion of the songs, and we will utilize a Javascript interactive feature (the DOM audio play() method) to play the samples. We are also planning to incorporate more Javascript features, such as when the album is clicked, it is displayed larger on the screen with the song suggestions on the side. The content will also be displayed on multiple pages that can be accessed throughout the entire website, and these different pages will be the different genres. The home screen, however, will have all of the albums listed in some order, i.e. chronologically or alphabetically, with their songs. As for the API component, we are currently looking into a search engine API where users will be able to click on the album cover and data will be fetched to provide more information about the artist and album which will appear on the screen. While we haven’t solidified the API we are going to use and are  looking through https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis (Links to an external site.) and https://rapidapi.com (Links to an external site.) we think we may use the Google Search API, which is found at: https://rapidapi.com/marcelinhov2/api/google-search1/endpoints. Another thought we have for the website is to load all of the MP3 files and their corresponding album/artist into a JSON generator (such as http://www.objgen.com/json) and then parse through that to load all of the data, so we don’t have to tediously hard code it all.
